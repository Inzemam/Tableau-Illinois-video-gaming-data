Here is the data for the Video Gaming Project: IllinoisVideoGamingRevenueReport_2012-2018.csv   Also useful will be this data set which lists all of the cities in Illinois, and the county that they are in: IL-City-County.csv   The gaming data was gathered from the Illinois Gaming Board website: https://www.igb.illinois.gov/VideoReports.aspx  This data set includes monthly information from each municipality in the state of Illinois. In order to get this data,  the page requires submitting a form once for each month, which downloaded the data for that single month as a csv file.  There may be ways of scripting this, but as it was non-trivial, it was taking longer to investigate than to just submit the form once for each month.   Once I had a file for each of the 65 months, I wrote a python script to generate a single data set from these separate files.  Adding the corresponding date to the beginning of each entry from each file.
